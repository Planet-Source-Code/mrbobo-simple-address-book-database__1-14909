Simple Address Book Database
This is in response to a 'Request for Code' in the discussion forum.
It's similar to lots of other submissions of address book style apps.
It shows how to create and access a database without any data controls - just by referencing 'Microsoft DAO 3.6 Object Library'. Purely an introduction to databases - nothing more. A simple address book in 160 lines of code, easily expanded, with lots of comments to guide a beginner through the code.
